The Inclined Planes Study Program is a beginner's program written in C++ that allows you to calculate important parameters related to objects on inclined planes in physics. With this program, you can determine the weight, normal force, maximum friction force, and friction coefficient required to avoid slipping down the slope. By providing the mass and angle of the plane, you can obtain valuable insights into the forces acting on the object and the conditions necessary for maintaining its position on the inclined plane.

Features:

Input the mass and angle of the plane to compute the various parameters.

- Calculate the weight of an object.
- Determine the normal force exerted on the object perpendicular to the inclined plane.
- Calculate the maximum friction force that can be applied to prevent the object from sliding down the slope.
- Obtain the friction coefficient required to maintain static equilibrium on the inclined plane.

Getting Started:

To get started with the Inclined Planes Study Program, follow these simple steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher.
- Run the compiled binary and provide the necessary inputs, such as the mass of the object and the angle of the inclined plane.
- View the calculated results, including the weight, normal force, maximum friction force, and friction coefficient.

Enjoy!
